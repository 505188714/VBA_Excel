# 
# Most of Excel jobs are:
# 1. Create tables for data collection
# 2. Make sure data clean with validation
# 3. Calculation
# 4. Make right formats
# 5. Comparison & Sorting
# 6. Privots
# 7. Save as reports
# 8. Protection

# I am planning to create a central spreadsheet, and VBA will take care all of these needs.
